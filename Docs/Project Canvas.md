### **Suggested GPS Radius for Pick-up Detection**

* **Radius estimate**: **50–100 meters** — close enough for precise student pick-up while allowing safe tram deceleration and stopping zone.
* **Dynamic radius approach**: use **30–120 m** dynamically adjusted by context:
    - Low-speed campus zones / during peak pedestrian traffic: **30–50 m** for precise pickup safety.
    - Open/campus-connector stretches where tram can safely decelerate earlier: **75–120 m**.
- Implement **geo-fencing + predictive braking buffer**: radius must factor tram speed, braking distance, and safe stopping area — computed by software at runtime.
- Use a two-step confirmation: user requests stop within radius → app prompts “Confirm pickup” if outside safe stopping zone; tram receives request and computes whether to stop or propose nearest safe stop.
- Add fallbacks: if GPS poor, use BLE beacons at stops or campus Wi-Fi triangulation to improve localization.
